##StudySparx

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the lack in tools for students that are incentive-oriented and accessibility-centric. 

## What it does
Our key feature is the combination of our in-house Pomodoro technique and Sparx, a "currency" that you earn as you progress in focused time and one that you can spend with personalized rewards. We take into both short- and long-term goals, both timed and tasks.

## How we built it
First, we used Figma to create wireframes of Study Sparx. We then used Next.js and TailwindCSS to create an intuitive user interface that helps track timed goals and tasks. By using components and Next.js's framework, we were able to easily delegate tasks amongst the team. Furthermore, for the back-end we utilized Redis as a tool. 

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge for us was bridging our knowledge based on coursework, previous experience, and docs to a practical application, especially for technologies we had not seen before like Redis and Taipy.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were proud of our ability to prioritize which tasks to complete under the time pressure. This also allowed us to evaluate what was important to us, which was providing a tool for individuals with ADHD and ADD, thus pushing us to focus on features such as our timed goals feature.

## What we learned
We learned that ultimately, community matters a lot. Thanks to the friends we made here and of course, Isa, we were able to progress farther than we otherwise would have. Looking forward, we will all be more appreciative of the communities hackathons inherently foster.
